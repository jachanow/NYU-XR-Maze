For this maze assignment I decided to go with the basic included office assets. I made the key with probuilder as per the instructions. I found this assignment to be quite challenging as there are a lot of moving parts to keep track of. I found the unity forums, stack exchange, the class forum, and google to be the most helpful. I often went to test my application when the instructor did and found that it simply would not work. All these resource helped me to fix simple mistakes I made such as selecting a layer/tag or checking the isTrigger box. If I were to do this assignment again I think i would use the assets from a low-poly mega pack on  the asset store. This would provide a lot of options for details as well as great performance.
